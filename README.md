## Overview

DuckDB is a high-performance analytical database designed to run in-process. While it is incredibly fast for OLAP tasks, its internal architecture means that **Connection** and **PreparedStatement** objects are **not thread-safe**. Sharing a single connection across multiple threads without manual synchronization leads to undefined behavior or crashes.

**Async-DuckDB** provides a non-blocking, thread-safe proxy layer. It allows any number of application threads to share a single DuckDB database instance by marshalling all calls to a dedicated worker thread. This eliminates the need for complex locking in your application code.

## Architectural Benefits

*   **Thread Affinity**: All raw DuckDB engine calls are executed on a single background "DuckDB Thread."
*   **Eliminates Lock Contention**: User threads never block each other waiting for database access; tasks are queued and executed sequentially.
*   **Non-Blocking UI/Logic**: Heavy analytical queries can be dispatched using `std::future`, keeping the main thread responsive.
*   **Materialized Results**: Query results are automatically materialized on the worker thread before being returned, ensuring they are safe to access from any thread.
*   **Sequential Integrity**: Database operations are guaranteed to execute in the order they were dispatched (FIFO).

- [DelegateMQ](https://github.com/endurodave/DelegateMQ) - The underlying messaging middleware used for thread marshalling.

## Quick Start

```cpp
#include "DuckDB/async_duckdb.hpp"

int main() {
    async::init_worker(); // Start the background thread

    async::Database db(":memory:");
    async::Connection conn(db);

    conn.Query("CREATE TABLE test (val INTEGER);");
    conn.Query("INSERT INTO test VALUES (42);");

    auto result = conn.Query("SELECT * FROM test;");
    // Use result...

    async::shutdown_worker();
}
```

## Design Pattern

Async-DuckDB employs the **Proxy/Worker** pattern using C++ Delegates:
1.  **Proxy Objects**: `async::Connection`, `async::PreparedStatement`, etc., act as lightweight handles.
2.  **Delegate Marshalling**: When an API is called, a delegate is created containing the task.
3.  **Task Queue**: The delegate is dispatched to the background worker thread's message queue.
4.  **Synchronous/Asynchronous Execution**: The proxy waits for a signal (Sync) or returns a `std::future` (Async).

## API Usage

### Simple Query
Standard blocking call. The calling thread waits until the query completes on the worker thread.
```cpp
auto result = conn.Query("SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1;");
```

### Asynchronous Futures
Dispatches the query and returns immediately. Ideal for long-running analytical tasks.
```cpp
std::future<std::unique_ptr<duckdb::QueryResult>> future = conn.QueryFuture("SELECT avg(val) FROM large_table;");

// ... do other work ...

auto result = future.get(); // Get the result when ready
```

### Prepared Statements
Thread-safe parameter binding. Each `Bind` call is marshalled to the worker thread to ensure the statement state is updated correctly before execution.
```cpp
auto stmt = conn.Prepare("INSERT INTO products VALUES (?, ?, ?);");
stmt->Bind(1, 101);
stmt->Bind(2, "Laptop");
stmt->Bind(3, 1200.50);
stmt->Execute();
```

### Appender (Bulk Loading)
Wraps the DuckDB Appender API for high-speed data ingestion.
```cpp
auto appender = conn.CreateAppender("metrics");
appender->BeginRow();
appender->Append(1.5);
appender->Append("cpu_usage");
appender->EndRow();
appender->Flush();
```

### Transactions
Full support for ACID transactions.
```cpp
conn.BeginTransaction();
try {
    conn.Query("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;");
    conn.Commit();
} catch (...) {
    conn.Rollback();
}
```

## Stress Testing

The repository includes a rigorous stress test (`Examples/StressTest.cpp`) that:
- Spawns **8 concurrent threads**.
- Performs **1,600 mixed operations** (synchronous inserts and asynchronous queries).
- Validates data integrity and ensures zero race conditions in parameter binding.

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang).
- CMake 3.10+.

### Windows (MSVC)
```powershell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

The build produces a single executable `Async-DuckDBApp` which runs all examples, stress tests, and unit tests.
